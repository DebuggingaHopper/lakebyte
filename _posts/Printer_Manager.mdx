title: Creating a printer troubleshooter Part 1 - Clearing the Printer Queue (wow so innovative)
description: Discussing Part 1 of  the creation of software that troubleshoots a printer for niche issues
---

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

Imagine getting over 20 calls in a month about the same issues:

    - The printer queue is jammed
    - The IP of the printer changed so the port needs to be edited
	
While your bashing your head as it takes longer to log in than to fix the issue, the head damage provided a brilliant idea, to create a program to handle it for you.

A batch script emerges as a possible savior but then it dawns on me:
- The solution will be on a device in a medical institution
- I should assume my user does not know what a terminal is

After (over)thinking for 4 hours, I decided a C# .Net Application that utilizes [Processes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process?view=net-9.0) and [prnport](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/prnport) would be best to remove the most obnoxious call in my teams workday.




<h2 align="center">Part 1 of The Printer Troubleshooter</h2>

We are not going to delve into the whole project in one article, instead we will delve into the main components:
- execute class - disassembles and executes a batch file to clear the queue
- userPrinter class - Handles the printer you will be troubleshooting with

To ensure the project is showcased in the best light, we will be just highlighting the most bare bone version of the project, so there will be no installer,unit tests or installer created for it.

<h3 align="center">Background Info</h3>

Before even making this program, what did I have to consider:

1. What is the problem to solve? - Jammed Printer Queue, and Iautomate changing an IP for a port
2. Who are the end-users? - regular people
3. Who will see the program files - Institution IT teams (the bane of developers)
4. What will be needed as input? - The user should not provide any input, all the necessary input is taken from the config file
5. What platform is this for? -  Windows PC's which have .NET 4.7 & 4.8 installed respectively


<h3 align="center">The Config file</h3>

So the user shouldn't need to know anything about the printer, so what's the best way to handle it, well a config file. In this bare bones config all we need is:
``` XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Configuration>
	<startup>
		<supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.7"/>
	</startup>
	<appSettings>
		<add key="PrinterName" value="PDFPrinter"/>
	</appSettings>
</Configuration>
```

Now that we got that little thing out of the way let's jump into it.


<h3 align="center">How to clear the queue?</h3>

All we need to is clear the printer queue. Well, a simple Google search shows a [batch file](https://community.spiceworks.com/t/clearing-print-cache-using-a-batch-file/1004358). This is a good start as this is something the user won't see, but how is the user supposed to know the job is finished?

[Printing a test page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58744651/i-need-a-batch-file-which-can-start-print-test-page-from-default-printer) is the perfect way to show the user the job is done, because we all know they wont want to waste a second to read a popup or bother to close it.

```bat
for /F "tokens=3 delims=: " %%H in ('sc query 'Spooler" ^| findstr "STATE"') DO (
	if /I "$%%H" NEQ "STOPPED" (
		net stop spooler
		del %systemroot%\System32\spool\printers\* /Q
		net start Spooler
	)
	if /I "$%%H" NEQ "RUNNING" (
		net start spooler
		net stop spooler
		del %systemroot%\System32\spool\printers\* /Q
		net start Spooler
	)
)
rundll32 printui.dll, PrintUIEntry /k /n %1
```

But would a batch file be all that's needed to solve the problem, and not an exe? 

I thought the same thing till I realized that it would not be wise for the final product to have a batch script publicly visible, let's not have an IT department place me into a choke hold. 

We never know when the printer would be acting up, so the exe should run the script when the user wants it to, but can we do this without getting interorgated?

<h4 align="center">Embedding the script</h4>

This was where the perspective shifted a bit, I wanted to make not only a secure program but also one that is able to stay afloat even after a couple of years.

To accomplish this I have a class that consists of the resourceName, and tempPath. enableFeatures is not relevant at the moment so disregard it


```c#
		public string resourceName { get; }
        public string tempPath { get;}
        public bool enableFeatures { get;}
        internal Execute()
        {
            resourceName = "LoccioniQueueManager.ClearQ.bat";
            tempPath = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + "\\LQM.bat";
            enableFeatures = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EnablePortFunc"] == "Y" ? true : false;
        }
```

I wanted to make this class a bit more interesting by allowing it to use the embedded batch file in the assembly, and doing everything in one go 

```c#
	    public void ExecuteMain(userPrinter currPrinter)
        {
            initiateSplash();
            if (this.enableFeatures)
            {
                currPrinter.changeIP();
            }
            var assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
            using (Stream input = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName))
            using (Stream output = File.Create(this.tempPath))
            {
                CopyStream(input, output);
            }
            ExecuteCommand(currPrinter.Name);
            File.Delete(this.tempPath);
        }

```

The CopyStream method blew my mind when i first found out what I could do was write the information from the assembely into a file. Could you believe it the batch file does not need to be explicitly in the folder when we run the code, it gets created in run time and then deleted after its use. 
```c#
        public void CopyStream(Stream input, Stream output)
        {
            byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
            int bytesRead;
            while ((bytesRead = input.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
            {
                output.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            }
        }
```

But wait what are these functions, variables and objects referenced. Even more how does this class even get to display the information to the user in a way they don't think I am hacking their computer.

<h4 align="center">Running the script from the exe</h4>

The core solution to the printer issue is resolved by running the batch file but how can we run it from the exe, this is where [Processes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process?view=net-9.0)  comes into play.

We create a new process which will be an instance of cmd running our batch file with the only argument being the name of the printer object
```C#
        public void ExecuteCommand(string printerName)
        {
            var processInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("cmd.exe", "/c " + this.tempPath + " " + "\"" + printerName + "\"")
            {
                CreateNoWindow = true,
                WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden,
                UseShellExecute = false,
                RedirectStandardError = true,
                RedirectStandardOutput = true

            };
            var process = Process.Start(processInfo);
            process.BeginOutputReadLine();
            process.BeginErrorReadLine();
            process.WaitForExit();
            process.Close();
        }
```

Through this API library, we can use the temporary batch file and run it without the user needing to see any command line terminal which is perfect.

So now we have the batch script ready to run in the exe, but wait how will the user know the program ran? Sure we have the test page but what if the user is impatient, remember the end-user wants something to tell them something is happening.



<h3 align="center">The splash screen</h3>
 
 All we are doing is running an instance of the splash screen in its thread so it shows for 7 seconds and then after those 7 seconds, we create the script, run it, and then delete it. 
```c#
 if (ms_frmSplash != null)
                return;
            Thread ms_oThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(StartForm));
            ms_oThread.Start();
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(7000);
            ms_oThread.Abort();
```

We want to create a new instance of the SplashScreen object when the thread is made, well thankfully this was not difficult.
```c#
        private void StartForm()
        {
            LQMSplash ms_frmSplash = new LQMSplash();
            Application.Run(ms_frmSplash);
        }
```

The biggest headache was creating the design of the screen, and adjusting to the ideal [splash screen sizes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/605965/standard-sizes-for-windows-splash-screens). After so many attempts, I was able to create the following:

<figure> <center> <img src="/assets/SplashScreen.PNG" alt="SPLASH_SCREEN" width="300" height="300" /> <figcaption> Splash Screen designed in figma</figcaption> </center></figure>



<h3 align="center">What is the userprinter class?</h3>

The userPrinter class serves as the only way to differentiate what printer we are working on when it deploy it to a new PC. This came up during my refactoring which will be later explored for part 2 of this article, so for now enjoy this barebones class.

```
ï»¿using System.Net;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Configuration;

namespace LoccioniQueueManager
{
    internal class userPrinter
    {
        public string Name { get;}
        internal userPrinter()
        {
            Name = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["PrinterName"];
        }
    }
}

```

<h3 align="center">Wait What About Administrator Privleages</h3>

We did all this work but we seemed to have forgotten about something, Restarting a service requires administrator privileges. How exactly are we going to approach that?

Well, there are two ways;
- Creating a task Scheduler script to run the program that will work even if the user is signed off, and creating a shortcut to said task scheduler script
- Creating a shortcut of the application with [savecred](https://community.spiceworks.com/t/run-program-with-admin-rights-shortcut/630687/6)

I prefer the first as that is the more secure method but the second works as well but I dislike it so much as it just violates the principle of least privileges. like seriously who in their right mind wants to do this willingly.

<h3 align="center">Final Product & Conclusion</h3>

Now that I have caused you dear reader to read through all this, here is the final product!
```
using System.Configuration;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Threading;
using System.Windows.Forms;
namespace LoccioniQueueManager
{
    internal class Execute
    {
        public string resourceName { get; }
        public string tempPath { get;}
        public bool enableFeatures { get;}
        internal Execute()
        {
            resourceName = "LoccioniQueueManager.ClearQ.bat";
            tempPath = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + "\\LQM.bat";
            enableFeatures = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EnablePortFunc"] == "Y" ? true : false;
        }

        readonly static LQMSplash ms_frmSplash = null;

        public void ExecuteMain(userPrinter currPrinter)
        {
            initiateSplash();
            if (this.enableFeatures)
            {
                currPrinter.changeIP();
            }
            var assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
            using (Stream input = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName))
            using (Stream output = File.Create(this.tempPath))
            {
                CopyStream(input, output);
            }
            ExecuteCommand(currPrinter.Name);
            File.Delete(this.tempPath);
        }

        public void ExecuteCommand(string printerName)
        {
            var processInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("cmd.exe", "/c " + this.tempPath + " " + "\"" + printerName + "\"")
            {
                CreateNoWindow = true,
                WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden,
                UseShellExecute = false,
                RedirectStandardError = true,
                RedirectStandardOutput = true

            };
            var process = Process.Start(processInfo);
            process.BeginOutputReadLine();
            process.BeginErrorReadLine();
            process.WaitForExit();
            process.Close();
        }

        public void CopyStream(Stream input, Stream output)
        {
            byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
            int bytesRead;
            while ((bytesRead = input.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
            {
                output.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            }
        }

        public void initiateSplash()
        {
            if (ms_frmSplash != null)
                return;
            Thread ms_oThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(StartForm));
            ms_oThread.Start();
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(7000);
            ms_oThread.Abort();
        }

        private void StartForm()
        {
            LQMSplash ms_frmSplash = new LQMSplash();
            Application.Run(ms_frmSplash);
        }
    }
}
```

With the program.cs looking like the following:
```
ï»¿namespace LoccioniQueueManager
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Execute ex = new Execute();
            userPrinter myPrinter = new userPrinter();
            ex.ExecuteMain(myPrinter);
        }
    }
}

```

This project was far from complex  but it was fun to construct based upon the restrictions I had placed onto myself and understanding the core audience of the program.

it is far from done, two things were not covered in this article:
- The installer
- how [prnport](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/prnport) was used in this project which would expand the userPrinter class

I wanted to just give an introduction to a bit of the madness I created.

The next article will delve more into how prnport was used while part 3 will show how the installer was made, as it was my first time making one and had me bashing my head at my hotel room desk.
