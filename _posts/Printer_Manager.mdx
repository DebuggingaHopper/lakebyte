title: Creating a printer troubleshooter Part 1 - Clearing the Printer Queue (wow so innovative)
description: Discussing Part 1 of  the creation of software that troubleshoots a printer for niche issues
---

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

Imagine getting over 20 calls in a month about a printer giving a problem, the issues always tend to be the same:
    - The printer queue is jammed
    - The IP of the printer changed so the port needs to be reconfigured
	

The amount of time it takes to log in to remote into the device to fix the printer always takes from 2 minutes to 15 minutes.

Initially, the issue could have been solved through a batch script but after taking into consideration the end-users and where this program would stay, I decided on a different approach.

Through a C# .Net Application that utilizes two libraries [Processes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process?view=net-9.0) and [prnport](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/prnport) this issue was able to be removed. Allowing the client to just continue with their day without needing to make a call, no news is good news (most of the time).




<h2 align="center">Part 1 of The Printer Troubleshooter</h2>

In this article we will detail the main components that create the first version of the printer troubleshooter:
- execute class - dissassembles and executes a batch file
- userPrinter class - the class for the printer being communicated with
This will not include any mention of prnport or the installer mentioned that helps with configruing the executables config file.

<h3 align="center">Background Info</h3>

Before even making this program there were some questions I needed to answer:

1. What is the problem to solve? - Jammed Printer Queue, and IP of the printer changes causing incongruincey with the port
2. Who are the end-users? - Individuals who most commonly do not have much experience with computers
3. Who will see the program files - IT teams monitoring the devices this executable is installed on
4. What will be needed as input? - The user should not provide any input, all the necessary input is taken from the config file
5. What platform is this for? - The PC models have .NET 4.7 & 4.8 installd respectively so for this to work we have to make a version for each


<h3 align="center">The Config file</h3>

Before diving into the code, the config file mentioned in the previous section consists of one parameter for this article:

- The printer name: this is the parameter that will be used the most to determine which printer to print a test page from

The config file would look like the following:
``` XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Configuration>
	<startup>
		<supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.7"/>
	</startup>
	<appSettings>
		<add key="PrinterName" value="PDFPrinter"/>
	</appSettings>
</Configuration>
```

Now that we got that little thing out of the way let's jump into it.


<h3 align="center">How to clear the queue?</h3>

To resolve the core issue on the printer, we would need to clear its queue. Well, a simple Google search can display that through a [batch file](https://community.spiceworks.com/t/clearing-print-cache-using-a-batch-file/1004358) the print spooler can be restarted, alongside clearing the queue. This is a good start as this is something the user won't see, but how is the user supposed to know the job is finished?

[Printing a test page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58744651/i-need-a-batch-file-which-can-start-print-test-page-from-default-printer) is the perfect way to show the user the job is done. Now of course we would need to create a config file for this application that takes the printer name, as we only need to do this for one printer.

So we have a batch script like the following.

```bat
for /F "tokens=3 delims=: " %%H in ('sc query 'Spooler" ^| findstr "STATE"') DO (
	if /I "$%%H" NEQ "STOPPED" (
		net stop spooler
		del %systemroot%\System32\spool\printers\* /Q
		net start Spooler
	)
	if /I "$%%H" NEQ "RUNNING" (
		net start spooler
		net stop spooler
		del %systemroot%\System32\spool\printers\* /Q
		net start Spooler
	)
)
rundll32 printui.dll, PrintUIEntry /k /n %1
```

But would a batch file be all that's needed to solve the problem, and not an exe? 

I thought the same thing till I realized that it would not be wise for the final product to have a batch script publically visible, let's not have an IT department place me into a chokehold. 

Additionally, we never know when the printer would be acting up, so instead of relying on a batch script have an exe run said script when the user wants it to run, but how can this be achieved without any security concerns with the batch script?

It's not hard to achieve it.

<h4 align="center">Embedding the script</h4>

This was where the perspective shifted a bit, we would like to do some practices that would prevent the program from being seen as an issue by an IT department and make this program still rely on 0 user input.

So first we create the execute class which will consist of the batch resource name, and temporary file path


As we have the config file we also want to use those values, You'll see some code referencing two variables which are the temporary location the file will go to, and the resource name we want to load
```c#
		public string resourceName { get; }
        public string tempPath { get;}
        public bool enableFeatures { get;}
        internal Execute()
        {
            resourceName = "LoccioniQueueManager.ClearQ.bat";
            tempPath = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + "\\LQM.bat";
            enableFeatures = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EnablePortFunc"] == "Y" ? true : false;
        }
```

The following function takes a printer object, creates the batch file and executes it with the properties of the printer object.

```c#
	    public void ExecuteMain(userPrinter currPrinter)
        {
            initiateSplash();
            if (this.enableFeatures)
            {
                currPrinter.changeIP();
            }
            var assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
            using (Stream input = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName))
            using (Stream output = File.Create(this.tempPath))
            {
                CopyStream(input, output);
            }
            ExecuteCommand(currPrinter.Name);
            File.Delete(this.tempPath);
        }

```

The CopyStream method referenced is the following which writes what was provided to the output.
```c#
        public void CopyStream(Stream input, Stream output)
        {
            byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
            int bytesRead;
            while ((bytesRead = input.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
            {
                output.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            }
        }
```

Perfect we found a way to embed the batch file and run it, but wait how are we running it, But wait what is this ExecuteCommand, printerObject, and initiateSplash?


<h4 align="center">Running the script from the exe</h4>

The core solution to the printer issue is resolved by running the batch file but how can we run it from the exe, this is where [Processes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process?view=net-9.0)  comes into play.

Through processes, we create a new process which will be cmd.exe running the batch file with the only parameter being the printer name.
```C#
        public void ExecuteCommand(string printerName)
        {
            var processInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("cmd.exe", "/c " + this.tempPath + " " + "\"" + printerName + "\"")
            {
                CreateNoWindow = true,
                WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden,
                UseShellExecute = false,
                RedirectStandardError = true,
                RedirectStandardOutput = true

            };
            var process = Process.Start(processInfo);
            process.BeginOutputReadLine();
            process.BeginErrorReadLine();
            process.WaitForExit();
            process.Close();
        }
```

Through this API library, we can use the temporary batch file and run it without the user needing to see any command line terminal which is perfect.

So now we have the batch script ready to run in the exe, but wait how will the user know the program ran? Sure we have the test page but what if the user is impatient, remember the end-user wants something to tell them something is happening.

This is where a splash screen comes into play.


<h3 align="center">The splash screen</h3>

Honestly, the code to run the splash screen is not difficult, all we are doing is running it in its thread so it shows for 7 seconds and then after those 7 seconds, we create the script, run it, and then delete it. This leads to the initiateSplash method shown below.
```c#
 if (ms_frmSplash != null)
                return;
            Thread ms_oThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(StartForm));
            ms_oThread.Start();
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(7000);
            ms_oThread.Abort();
```

Even the function StartForm is just creating a new instance of the SplashScreen object and having the application run it.
```c#
        private void StartForm()
        {
            LQMSplash ms_frmSplash = new LQMSplash();
            Application.Run(ms_frmSplash);
        }
```

The difficult part about the splash screen was creating the actual design, but thanks to Figma and the understanding of the ideal [splash screen sizes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/605965/standard-sizes-for-windows-splash-screens) I was able to create a decent design

<figure> <center> <img src="/assets/SplashScreen.PNG" alt="SPLASH_SCREEN" width="300" height="300" /> <figcaption> Splash Screen designed in figma</figcaption> </center></figure>


It achieved the main goal of telling the user exactly what to do without too much information, as the whole point of this executable is to minimize the amount of user input.


<h3 align="center">What is the userprinter class?</h3>

The userPrinter class serves as the printer object of the printer that will be primarly tampered with. This refactoring was necessray for part 2 of this article, so for now enjoy this barebones class.

```
﻿using System.Net;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Configuration;

namespace LoccioniQueueManager
{
    internal class userPrinter
    {
        public string Name { get;}
        internal userPrinter()
        {
            Name = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["PrinterName"];
        }
    }
}

```

<h3 align="center">Wait What About Administrator Privleages</h3>

We did all this work but we seemed to have forgotten about something, Restarting a service requires administrator privileges. How exactly are we going to approach that?

Well, there are two ways;
- Creating a task Scheduler script to run the program that will work even if the user is signed off, and creating a shortcut to said task scheduler script
- Creating a shortcut of the application with [savecred](https://community.spiceworks.com/t/run-program-with-admin-rights-shortcut/630687/6)

I prefer the first as that is the more secure method but the second works as well but I dislike it.

<h3 align="center">Final Product & Conclusion</h3>

So with all this, I was able to create a simple program that looked like the following:
```
using System.Configuration;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Threading;
using System.Windows.Forms;
namespace LoccioniQueueManager
{
    internal class Execute
    {
        public string resourceName { get; }
        public string tempPath { get;}
        public bool enableFeatures { get;}
        internal Execute()
        {
            resourceName = "LoccioniQueueManager.ClearQ.bat";
            tempPath = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + "\\LQM.bat";
            enableFeatures = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EnablePortFunc"] == "Y" ? true : false;
        }

        readonly static LQMSplash ms_frmSplash = null;

        public void ExecuteMain(userPrinter currPrinter)
        {
            initiateSplash();
            if (this.enableFeatures)
            {
                currPrinter.changeIP();
            }
            var assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
            using (Stream input = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName))
            using (Stream output = File.Create(this.tempPath))
            {
                CopyStream(input, output);
            }
            ExecuteCommand(currPrinter.Name);
            File.Delete(this.tempPath);
        }

        public void ExecuteCommand(string printerName)
        {
            var processInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("cmd.exe", "/c " + this.tempPath + " " + "\"" + printerName + "\"")
            {
                CreateNoWindow = true,
                WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden,
                UseShellExecute = false,
                RedirectStandardError = true,
                RedirectStandardOutput = true

            };
            var process = Process.Start(processInfo);
            process.BeginOutputReadLine();
            process.BeginErrorReadLine();
            process.WaitForExit();
            process.Close();
        }

        public void CopyStream(Stream input, Stream output)
        {
            byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
            int bytesRead;
            while ((bytesRead = input.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
            {
                output.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            }
        }

        public void initiateSplash()
        {
            if (ms_frmSplash != null)
                return;
            Thread ms_oThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(StartForm));
            ms_oThread.Start();
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(7000);
            ms_oThread.Abort();
        }

        private void StartForm()
        {
            LQMSplash ms_frmSplash = new LQMSplash();
            Application.Run(ms_frmSplash);
        }
    }
}
```

With the program.cs looking like the following:
```
﻿namespace LoccioniQueueManager
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Execute ex = new Execute();
            userPrinter myPrinter = new userPrinter();
            ex.ExecuteMain(myPrinter);
        }
    }
}

```

When the program is installed by our team, the printer name will have the desired value so when the program is running it will show the splash screen and you will then get a test page!

This was not a difficult program at all but it was fun to construct while taking into consideration not only my end-user but also the environment I was going to place it in. Plus I had to refactor the code right before new years.

However it is not done, two things were not covered in this article:
- The installer
- how [prnport](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/prnport) was used in this project which would expand the userPrinter class

This article was only part 1 of the project, as I wanted to first just give an introduction to the work done.

The next article will delve more into how prnport was used and while part 3 will show how the installer was made, as it was my first time making one and had me bashing my head at my hotel room desk.
